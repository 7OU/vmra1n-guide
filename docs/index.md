# Before we begin
**Please note**: I did not make vmra1n, or have anything to do with the it. Also, I am not responsible for any damage (if any occurs).
## What we will be doing in this guide?
In this guide, we will be using WubiUEFI to dual-boot the latest Non-LTS version of Ubuntu (If you do not have Linux already, Windows only program), installing QEMU, creating a macOS Mojave VM, and binding a USB controller to the VM.

## Requirements
