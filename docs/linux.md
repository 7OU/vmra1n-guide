# Dual-booting Linux
## Using WubiUEFI (Recommended)
This is the recommended as it is the easiest way to dual-boot, especially since
you don't need a USB. What you will need to do first is download WubiUEFI (which
the releases can be found
[here](https://github.com/hakuna-m/wubiuefi/releases)). Download the .exe file
from the latest pre-release, launch it, and if there is a UAC popup, accept it.
And follow the on-screen instructions, just remember you will want to set the
installation size to \>40GB. Press install and it will start downloading and
installing Ubuntu, once it is finished go ahead and reboot into Ubuntu.
## Manually installing a Linux distro
I recommend using WubiUEFI if you are fairly new to Linux, and I think that you
should know how to install a distro if you are not using WubiUEFI, just make
sure the distro you are using has QEMU v3.0 or higher.
